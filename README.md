# ExtendJ with Deconfined Intersection Types

This is an extension to [ExtendJ](https://extendj.org/) compiler. It implements
[a Java 8 language extension by Dezani-Ciancaglini, Giannini and Venneri](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2020/13225/) that allows an intersection type
(e. g. `I & J`) to be used everywhere a reference type is allowed. Just a subset
of intersection types is currently implemented, that is intersections of
(potentially parametrized) interfaces only.
